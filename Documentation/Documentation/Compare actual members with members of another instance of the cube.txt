! Compare actual members with members of another instance of the cube
This feature lets you compare the members of an hierarchy or level to the members of another hierarchy/level or to another instance of the cube. The main purpose of this feature is to let you compare members between different environments or between releases.
!! Assert
The assertion is not special, you can use the three classical asserters: _contain, subsetOf_ and _equivalentTo_. Inside your xml element, you'll need to define an element _members_ containing an element _level_ or _hierarchy_ exactly as for your system-under-test.
{code:xml}
<test name="Members of department bellow 'Corporate' are in a subset of themselves" uid="0001">  
    <system-under-test>  
        <members children-of="Corporate">  
            <hierarchy caption="Departments" dimension="Department" perspective="Adventure Works"/>  
        </members>  
    </system-under-test>  
    <assert>  
        <subsetOf>  
            <members children-of="Corporate" >  
                <hierarchy caption="Departments" dimension="Department" perspective="Adventure Works"
