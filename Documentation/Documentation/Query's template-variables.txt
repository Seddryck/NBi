! Query's template-variables
*New in v1.3*

You can use template-variables to dynamically build the statement of you SQL, MDX or DAX queries. Unlike a [Parameters in queries|parameters], a template-variable input is treated as a portion of executable code. 

When possible we highly recommend to use the parameters and not the template-values. The template-variables are more flexible to build dynamically your queries but can obfuscate your tests.

When creating a query with template-values, you identify the template-values by putting dollar signs ($) before and after the template-variable's name name. For example, $Year$ would be a valid template-variables name. 

In your test definition, in addition of the element _query_, you'll also need to describe your template-variable by defining its name and value within an element named _variable_.

{code:xml}
<query>
	select * from Customer where CustomerKey $OperatorVar$ (1,2,3)
	<variable name="OperatorVar">
		not in
	</variable>
</query>
{code:xml}

The query executed by NBi will be 

{code:sql}
select * from Customer where CustomerKey not in (1,2,3)
{code:sql}

!! Template-variables defined at the test-suite level

Sometimes you want to define a few template-variables at the test-suite level. It's useful when these template-variables are used in more than one query and their values are constant through the test-suite. This can be achieved by the usage of the element _parameter_ in the _default_ of the _settings_.

Within the code snippet here under we're defining a template-variable named _Clause_. This _Clause_ applies a slicer to limit the cube to the years 2010 to 2013.

{code:xml}
<settings>
	<default apply-to="system-under-test">
		<variable name="Clause">
			([DimTime].[Year].[2010]:[DimTime].[Year].[2013])
		</variable>
	</default>
</settings>
{code:xml}

This template-variable can be used in the following two queries without problems:
{code:xml}
<test>
	...
	<query>
		select
			$Clause$ on 0,
			[Measures].[My Value] on 1
		from
			[my cube]
	</query>
	...
</test>
<test>
	...
	<query>
		select
			[Measures].[My Value] on 0
		from
			[my cube]
		where
			$Clause$
	</query>
	...
</test>
{code:xml}

If a template-variable is defined at the test-suite level and at the query level, the definition at the query level will be used.

If a template-variable is not used within a query but is provided to this query, this template-variable is simply not used by NBi (so it's not a problem).
