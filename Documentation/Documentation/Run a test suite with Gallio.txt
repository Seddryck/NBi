! Run a test suite with Gallio
For this tutorial, we presuppose [url:Gallio|http://www.gallio.org/Downloads.aspx] (Icarius) is installed on your system. You've also downloaded the binaries of NBi (and [url:NUnit|http://nunit.org/?p=download]) and copied them in a unique directory.  In this directory you'll need following dlls:
* NUnit.Framework.dll (needed by NBi to delegate the execution of tests after transformation)
* NBi.Xml.dll (needed to interpret correctly the Xml (nbits) file and transform it into an effective test suite.
* NBi.NUnit.dll (Implementation of the assertions specific to NUnit)
* NBi.Core.dll (Needed to execute the queries, transform tests results, ...)
* NBi.NUnit.Runtime.dll (The point of connection between NBi and NUnit)

Before starting with Gallio Icarius, you need to reference your test-suite (Nbits file) to NBi. For this, you've several options. You can simply put a file with the extension *".nbits"* in the same directory than dll _NBi.NUnit.Runtime.dll_. This file will be interpreted by the framework as the definition of the test-suite you want to run. If more than one ".nbits" file is available in this directory, NBi will choose one of them (the first file found in alphabetic order).

An alternative is to create a file named NBi.NUnit.Runtime.dll.config (*with "dll"*!). In this file, just add the standard configuration of an NBi test-suite including the path to your test suite. In the sample bellow, the test suite is defined in the sub-directory named "SubDirectory" in file "myTestSuite.nbits".
{code:xml}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
	<configSections>
		<section name="nbi" type="NBi.NUnit.Runtime.NBiSection, NBi.NUnit.Runtime"/>
	</configSections>
	<nbi testSuite="SubDirectory\myTestSuite.nbits"/>
</configuration>
{code:xml}
Then, start Gallio Icarius and choose the menu option "file > new project". Then click on "+ Add file" button and select the dll named *NBi.NUnit.Runtime.dll* (available in your installation folder).

This dll will read your test-suite previously created and NUnit/NBi then will parse and interpret it. The list of tests is populated and displayed in your UI (It can take a few seconds). Now, you just need to select your tests and execute them with Gallio Icarius.
