! Test availability of a member at any level of a dimension or hierarchy
!! System under test
If you're not familiar with the way to perform a test on dimension's members, you should take a look to [Members' count|Test the members' count at any level of a dimension or hierarchy].
!! Assertion
The assertion consists in a check that one of members in the hierarchy or level has a given caption. So we need to specify that we'll perform an assertion of type "contains":
{code:xml}
<test>
    <assert>
        <contains/>
    </assert>
</test>
{code:xml}
Then we need to stipulate the caption to look for:
{code:xml}
<contains caption="MyMember"/>
{code:xml}
If we're checking that the hierarchy named "MyHierarchy" has a member named "MyMember":
{code:xml}
<test>
    <system-under-test>
        <members 
            path="[MyDimension].[MyHierarchy]"
            perspective="myPerspective" 
            connectionString="Provider=MSOLAP.4;Data Source=MyServer;Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=MyCube;"
        />
    </system-under-test>
    <assert>
        <contains caption="MyMember"/>
    </assert>
</test>
{code:xml}
