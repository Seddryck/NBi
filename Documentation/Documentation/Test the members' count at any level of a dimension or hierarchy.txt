! Test the members' count at any level of a dimension or hierarchy 
!! System under test
If you're not familiar with the way to specify a test on members of a dimension, read first the article about [Tests on dimension's members].

!! Assertion
The assertion consists in a check about the members' count in the hierarchy or level specified.
So we need to specify that we'll perform an assertion of type "count":
{code:xml}
<test>
    <assert>
        <count/>
    </assert>
</test>
{code:xml}
The we need to specify one of the following option:
* exactly
* more-than
* less-than
(It's also possible to combine more-than and less-than)
{code:xml}
<count more-than="5" less-than="10"/>
{code:xml}

If we're checking that the hierarchy named "MyHierarchy" has more than 15 members:
{code:xml}
<test>
    <system-under-test>
	    <members>
		    <hierarchy caption="State-Province" dimension="Customer" perspective="Adventure Works"
			     connectionString="Provider=MSOLAP.4;Data Source=MyServer;Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=MyCube;"
		     />
	    </members>
    </system-under-test>
    <assert>
        <count more-than="15"/>
    </assert>
</test>
{code:xml}
