! Test the members' count at any level of a dimension or hierarchy 
!! System under test
In order to let you check something about members of a dimension (or hierarchy/level), you need to stipulate where you'll be looking for. This is done by creating a tag named "members" under the node "system-under-test".
{code:xml}
<test>
    <system-under-test>
        <members/>
    </system-under-test>
</test>
{code:xml}

In this node, named "members", you'll need to specify on which element you'll be looking for. This is done by filling the xml element named "dimension", "hierarchy" or "level". As a sample here we're looking for a member in the level 'State-Province' of hierarchy 'State-Province' in dimension 'dimension='Customer'.
{code:xml}
<system-under-test>
	<members>
		<level caption="State-Province" dimension="Customer" hierarchy="State-Province" perspective="Adventure Works"/>
	</members>
</system-under-test>
{code:xml}
If we want to search in the hierarchy,
{code:xml}
<system-under-test>
	<members>
		<hierarchy caption="State-Province" dimension="Customer" perspective="Adventure Works"/>
	</members>
</system-under-test>
{code:xml}
Finally, the last information needed is the connectionString to reach your cube. This information must be provided by the means of the xml attribute named "connectionString" (or via a default value).
{code:xml}
<system-under-test>
	<members>
		<hierarchy caption="State-Province" dimension="Customer" perspective="Adventure Works"
			connectionString="Provider=MSOLAP.4;Data Source=MyServer;Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=MyCube;"
		/>
	</members>
</system-under-test>
{code:xml}

!! Assertion
The assertion consists in a check about the members' count in the hierarchy or level specified.
So we need to specify that we'll perform an assertion of type "count":
{code:xml}
<test>
    <assert>
        <count/>
    </assert>
</test>
{code:xml}
The we need to specify one of the following option:
* exactly
* more-than
* less-than
(It's also possible to combine more-than and less-than)
{code:xml}
<count more-than="5" less-than="10"/>
{code:xml}

If we're checking that the hierarchy named "MyHierarchy" has more than 15 members:
{code:xml}
<test>
    <system-under-test>
	    <members>
		    <hierarchy caption="State-Province" dimension="Customer" perspective="Adventure Works"
			     connectionString="Provider=MSOLAP.4;Data Source=MyServer;Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=MyCube;"
		     />
	    </members>
    </system-under-test>
    <assert>
        <count more-than="15"/>
    </assert>
</test>
{code:xml}
