! Test the members' count at any level of a dimension or hierarchy 
!! System under test
In order to let you check something about members of a dimension (or hierarchy/level), you need to stipulate where you'll be looking for. This is done by creating a tag named "members" under the node "system-under-test".
{code:xml}
<test>
    <system-under-test>
        <members/>
    </system-under-test>
</test>
{code:xml}

In this node, named "members", you'll need to specify the path to reach the container of the element you're checking availability. This is done by filling the xml attribute named "path" with the unique of your dimension,
{code:xml}
<structure path="[MyDimension].[MyHierarchy]"/>
{code:xml}
or the level,
{code:xml}
<structure path="[MyDimension].[MyHierarchy].[MyLevel]"/>
{code:xml}
When done, it'll also be neeeded to specify the perspective through which you'll be executing your test. To do this, fill the xml attribute named "perspective". Note that perspectives have no unique name, so you must fill this information with the perspective's displayname (and so without brackets).
{code:xml}
<structure path="[MyDimension].[MyHierarchy]" perspective="myPerspective"/>
{code:xml}
Finally, the last information needed is the connectionString to reach your cube. This information must be provided by the means of the xml attribute named "connectionString".
{code:xml}
<structure path="[MyDimension].[MyHierarchy]" perspective="myPerspective" 
    connectionString="Provider=MSOLAP.4;Data Source=MyServer;Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=MyCube;"/>
{code:xml}

!! Assertion
The assertion consists in a check about the count of members in the hierarchy or level specified.

So we need to specify that we'll perform an assertion of type "count":
{code:xml}
<test>
    <assert>
        <count/>
    </assert>
</test>
{code:xml}
The we need to specify one of the following option:
* exactly
* more-than
* less-than
(It's also possible to combine more-than and less-than)
{code:xml}
<count more-than="5" less-than="10"/>
{code:xml}

If we're checking that the hierarchy named "MyHierarchy" has more than 15 members:
{code:xml}
<test>
    <system-under-test>
        <members 
            path="[MyDimension].[MyHierarchy]"
            perspective="myPerspective" 
            connectionString="Provider=MSOLAP.4;Data Source=MyServer;Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=MyCube;"
        />
    </system-under-test>
    <assert>
        <count more-than="15"/>
    </assert>
</test>
{code:xml}
