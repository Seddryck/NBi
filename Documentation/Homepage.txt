!! Project Description
{project:description}
The main goal of this framework is to let users create tests with a declarative approach based on an Xml syntax. By the means of NBi, you don't need to develop C# code to specify your tests! Either, you don't need Visual Studio to compile your test suite. Just create an Xml file and let the framework interpret it and play your tests. The framework is designed as an add-on of NUnit but with the possibility to port it easily to other testing frameworks.

!! Documentation
[Documentation] is now updated for release *1.5* (new features and improvements are explicitly identified). This documentation includes a list of "how to" for beginners and the usage of some elements in NBi syntax to manage test cases (description, ignore, edition, category).

* [Manually create my first test suite with NBi|Create manually my first test suite with NBi]
* [Run a test suite with NUnit GUI]
* [Run a test suite with Gallio]
* [Share binaries between test-suites] (useful for build servers)

! Currently supported features
